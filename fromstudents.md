You should take this course if you want real world experience in how teams use current technologies to work as a team. This class teaches crucial skills that you may not have had beforehand. It is like a class that pieces together many smaller previous topics and explains how they all work together. Git is one of the main topics in this course and as my time in the class comes to an end I can say that it is one of the most useful techniques you can learn before diving real deep into CS.

You should take this class if you want to be introduced to some topics prior to taking 411 and 412. This class also allows you to gain some experience using the terminal, understanding the term `computing` and the topics surrounding it, and using version control systems such as git which are useful in the professional world. 

This class offers great experience with real world computer science tools like github. This class will also expose you to 
intermediate computer science concepts. In total the skills learned in this class will make you a much more rounded computer science student. 


You should take this class if you want to know more about what your computer is doing. This class will help you better understand error messages and will teach you bash
scripting and git. I have not taken 411 yet but I hear this class is good to take before 411. I also believe this class is good to take before 305 because we use git a lot in that
class.

You should take this class if you want to get a headstart on your education and
career. This class covers quite a bit, but each topic is designed to give you
just enough so that you're not completely in the dark when you have to learn
this stuff for a class. Additionally, being comfortable with version control
systems is essential for not only school projects, but also your internships
and jobs.


You should take this course if you want to get acquainted with the basic skills needed to use github and bash, two applications that will be used in the workplace.
This class will also teach you background information on how computers work, both in how the a cs language interacts with the computer but also how the hardware relates to the processes of a computer and its languages.


This course offers an extrely helpful understanding of both git and github, I believe it would be especially benificial to take before CSC305 and
CSC412 which both use knowledge that would be leaned in this course. I found that this course was able to help be strengthen my understanding on git and
github in such a way that I know it will be benifiical to my education and career moving forward. 


You should take this course if you want experience with different tools used in the computer science field or more knowledge on how IDEs' and programming lanaguages
work. This class gets your feet wet in many different aspects and you are able to gain alot of knowlegde within a short period of time with the assignments. 


You should take this class if you want to understand more of a real software developer's workflow 
and begin to create your own code in a more professional way. The level of comfort that I have 
gained with Git is something that I believe will be invaluable to me as I enter my career as a 
professional developer. Getting more comfortable with working in the terminal and using simple 
bash scripts to automate tasks is another thing that I learned in this class which greatly increased 
my work efficiency. Getting introduced to some of the core topics for 411 and 412 ahead of time 
is also a huge benefit to this class as it will save you a ton of time when taking those courses.


You should take this class if you want to learn more about git, github, and how to use the terminal.


YOu should take this class because it introduces you to new concepts about computer science. It helps 
you gain experience/knowledge about real world applications. For example, we go over a lot of github 
commnads and the many things you can do with github. This will help you in the real world but also while 
your still in school. Currently, I am stil only in CSC 212 but I have already used github a bunch. With 
this class, I can now use github better. 

You should take this class if you want to see how things will go in your future CSC classes this is a opportunity to learn about something that can be very benefical to you inside your future classes. You learn alot about the history of github and computers and topic that you would normally not see in other CSC classes. Your taught how to use version controls with GITHUB and how to approach projects with different languages. 

This class offers experience with working with groups on assignments, yall know how to approach your assignments for other classes in the future and you will be better prepared to do work and know what language u will need in the future. 


I believe this class is important because for a student like me I did not know how to start my projects and I wasnt to secure with programming but alot of the assignments for example made me research into other languages that are like the famous ones and I found it really interesting because it showed me there were more programming languages out there beside C and java. This will also allow you to learn scripting and bash which getting a head start with your future classes will help.


Although this class might sound intimidating because of all the advanced concepts that may seem hard, when you take the time to learn in class and the different exercises, it creates a much better understanding of these seemingly complicated topics, such as Git, repositories, memory, abstraction, etc. With the knowledge of this class, it will definetly help with higher level courses where the topics you learned are the standard and how they will use vocab from this course. It will also help with organizing programming projects by learning about Git and how to maintain a repository and especially with fixing errors when working in team.
